"""\
Packets exchanged between the poker server and a poker client.

When a packet is said to be "inferred" by the client, it means
that it is not sent by the server because the
client can deduce the corresponding event from the previous packets.
The pokerclient protocol hide this difference by creating events as if they
were received from the server. The distinction should only matter for
a program willing to talk directly to the server, in wich case it is safe
to assume that all packet marked as being "inferred" will not actually be received by the server. In order to keep the
complexity of writing the client to a reasonable level, the server
provides exhaustive information about the game before the beginning of
every turn.

The "Direction:" field for each packet shows wether it travels from
the client to the server (server <= client), from the server to the
client (server => client) or both ways (server <=> client). Packets
that are never used for client / server dialog, i.e. which are
infered by the client and used internally are noted with
client <=> client.

The main pot is never refered as such and is considered to be the
pot with the largest index. If there are three pots (index 0, 1, 2),
it is safe to assume that the pot with index 2 is the main pot.

The terms table/game are used interchangeably depending on the context.

The documentation is kept terse and emphasizes the non-intuitive
behaviour associated to each packet.

    Context     this packet is sent even when there is no showdown, i.e. when all
                other players folded. However, it is not sent if the game is canceled
                (i.e. :class:`PACKET_POKER_CANCELED <pokerpackets.networkpackets.PacketPokerCanceled>` is sent). It is sent after
                the :class:`PACKET_POKER_STATE <pokerpackets.networkpackets.PacketPokerState>` packet announcing the "end" state and after all

                packet information for checking purposes only.

                The client infers the following packets from :class:`PACKET_POKER_WIN <pokerpackets.networkpackets.PacketPokerWin>`:

                :class:`PACKET_POKER_PLAYER_NO_CARDS <pokerpackets.clientpackets.PacketPokerPlayerNoCards>`

                :class:`PACKET_POKER_PLAYER_CHIPS <pokerpackets.networkpackets.PacketPokerPlayerChips>`

                They roughly match the following logic. Some players mucked their
                losing cards (:class:`PACKET_POKER_PLAYER_NO_CARDS <pokerpackets.clientpackets.PacketPokerPlayerNoCards>`). The winners show their
                best five card combination (high and/or low)
                :class:`PACKET_POKER_BEST_CARDS <pokerpackets.clientpackets.PacketPokerBestCards>`. If there are split pots and a player wins
                more than one pot, merge the chips together before giving them to the
                winner (:class:`PACKET_POKER_CHIPS_POT_MERGE <pokerpackets.clientpackets.PacketPokerChipsPotMerge>`). Give each player the part of
                the pot they won (PACKET_POKER_CHIPS_POT2PLAYER): there may be more
                than one packet for each player if more than one pot is involved. When
                the distribution is finished all pots are empty
                (:class:`PACKET_POKER_POT_CHIPS <pokerpackets.clientpackets.PacketPokerPotChips>`) and each player has a new amount of chips in
                their stack (:class:`PACKET_POKER_PLAYER_CHIPS <pokerpackets.networkpackets.PacketPokerPlayerChips>`). These last two packets make
                it possible for the client to ignore the chips movements and only deal
                with the final chips amounts.

                The :class:`PACKET_POKER_BEST_CARDS <pokerpackets.clientpackets.PacketPokerBestCards>` is only infered for actual winners. Not
                for players who participated in the showdown but lost. The cards of
                these losers are known from a :class:`PACKET_POKER_CARDS <pokerpackets.networkpackets.PacketPokerCards>` sent before the

    Semantics           The player "serial" wishes to join a table that matches the

                        has the most players already seated (but with a seat available
                        for the requesting player) will be returned.  An error is
                        returned if such a table cannot be found.  If multiple tables
                        are equally appropriate, the one with the smallest serial is
                        returned.

                        Note that the player has to be logged in order to pick a table,
                        the "serial" field is mandatory.

                        An additional criterion that is *not* sent by the user (but
                        rather inferred by the server) is as follows: cash game tables

                        to the player in a given currency are eliminated from
                        consideration.

                        If a table matching the criteria is available, it will be as if
                        the client had sent the following sequence of packets (plus
                        performed the pseudo-code logic below on client side)::

                        In this case of success, the client can expect to receive all
                        the packets that it would expect to receive in response to any
                        of the packets listed in "Send" above.  These include::

                               PacketPokerSeats()

                        Note even if a valid PacketPokerTable() is received, it's
                        possible, although unlikely, that the intervening operations --

                        might fail.  If one of them fails, the client should expect to
                        receive the normal errors it would receive if such an operation
                        failed.  Clients are advised, upon receiving a valid
                        PacketPokerTable() in response, to use the same handling
                        routines that it uses for PacketPokerSeat(), PacketPokerBuyIn()
                        and PacketPokerSit() to keep parity with the operations the
